## Overview
This analysis is of UFO sightings. The purpose is to single out these sightings by category. Making a webpage to allow others to access this information in an organized matter will allow anyone to sift through to find specific data.

## Results
* In order to sift through the data, the first step is to open the HTML file called 'index'.![Pic  of Index](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106329824/187041907-b5bf746e-1d4c-44a2-ac4f-b40dce7641fb.png)
* This will get you to the website that is already loaded with all the data in the original file. 
* In order to search, you pick from any of the five fields. ![Pic  of Fields](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106329824/187042101-c4ee5d63-2146-4834-81cf-078b43a5dedc.png)
* Filling out those fields and pressing enter will give an output of the desired sightings.

## Summary
Overall, this page and analysis is helpful in quick parsing through data. A set back of the design is the data will not continue to update as more sightings go on. A recommendation I have is to use an api instead of a single dataset. Another recommendation would be to add a comment section or the ability to like specific sightings on the HTML file. This would allow more interaction for those doing research on unidentified flying objects.
